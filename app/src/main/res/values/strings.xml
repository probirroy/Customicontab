<string name="large_text">One of the latest widgets introduced in Android is RecyclerView. Many say its a replacement of existing ListView widget, also termed as ListView 2.0. I browsed though the entire world wide web, in search of a working Android RecyclerView example with explanation. Gotta say couldnâ€™t find one. After a lot of struggle I finally made one and decided to write a tutorial for it my self. So here it goes, in this Android RecyclerView Tutorial I would demonstrate a working example of RecyclerView, with some basic functionality. Where I would show you how to include a RecyclerView into an Android app project with an onItemClick event.
        Android RecyclerView falls under the material design of android. Hence to maintain backward compatibility, first I would suggest you to go through my article on maintaining backward compatibility of material design. I will try to keep this tutorial on Android RecyclerView short and simple as it consists a huge number of classes and each one of them is designed to be customized.</string>
